# TransitMail Client

TransitMail is a lightweight Progrssive Web Ppplication (PWA) email client, designed to take the hard work out of establishing email services.

The key features of TransitMail as follows:

<ul>
<li>Built in ReactJS</li>
<li>Built with Bootstrap</li>
<li>Works as a Progessive Web Application</li>
<li>Relies only on traditional IMAP and SMTP protocals</li>
<li>Uses WebSockets for it communications</li>
<li>Easy to use, setup and deploy</li>
</ul>

The benefits to TransitMail is that with this combination of services, SSL certificate negoitation happens at the WebSocket layer. This meaning that SMTPS and IMAP-SSL are not required, therefore, keeping complex mail server configuration to a minimum, while at the same time maintaining secure communications.
